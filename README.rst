DerbyPy - Circuits Demo (2017-02)
==============================================

This project presents some basic concepts of I/O and CPU blocking, along with a couple of
threading demos. The Circuits demos are mainly drawn from the Circuits tutorials
(https://circuits.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the examples given in their repository
(https://github.com/circuits/circuits/tree/master/examples).

You can set up a virtual environment with the needed libraries using the requirements file
included here:

    pip install -r requirements/all.txt
